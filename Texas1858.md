In 1858 [State Law in Texas](https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6730/m1/1095/) provided funds for the translation of laws of the State into Spanish, German, and Norwegian, "provided the said printing shall be done in Texas". Those languages are roughly the ones covered by the Microsoft [US International](https://kbdlayout.info/kbdusx) and [Greek-Latin](https://kbdlayout.info/kbdgkl) keyboards, with no dead keys. 

This keyboard layout (Texas 1858) implements the NoDeadKeys (AltGr) section of the said Microsoft kbdusx and kbdgkl keyboard layouts, covering the letters and punctuation required by these languages in the [ISO-8859-1 codepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_1), with supplemental punctuation from the [Win1252 codepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win1252). Punctuation has been fairly rearranged trying to improve mnemonics.
