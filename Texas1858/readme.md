In 1858 [State Law in Texas](https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6730/m1/1095/) provided funds for the translation of laws of the State into Spanish, German, and Norwegian, "provided the said printing shall be done in Texas". Those languages are roughly the ones covered by the Microsoft [US International](https://kbdlayout.info/kbdusx) and [Greek-Latin](https://kbdlayout.info/kbdgkl) keyboards, with no dead keys. 

The keyboard layout kbdtx37a implements the NoDeadKeys (AltGr) section of the said Microsoft kbdusx and kbdgkl keyboard layouts, covering only the letters and punctuation required by these languages in the intersection of the [IBM923/ISO-8859-15 codepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_9), and the [IBM/DOS 858 codepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP858). Punctuation has been rearranged trying to keep nonletters as such, but preserving muscle memory from Windows keyboard layouts as much as possible. The keyboard layout number is the average between 923 and 858, i.e. 890, in hexadecimal, rounded to a multiple of 32.
