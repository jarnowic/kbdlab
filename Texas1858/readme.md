In 1858 [State Law in Texas](https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6730/m1/1095/) provided funds for the translation of laws of the State into Spanish, German, and Norwegian, "provided the said printing shall be done in Texas". Those languages are roughly the ones covered by the Microsoft [US International](https://kbdlayout.info/kbdusx) and [Greek-Latin](https://kbdlayout.info/kbdgkl) keyboards, with no dead keys. 

The keyboard layout `kbdtx37a` implements the NoDeadKeys (AltGr) section of the said Microsoft kbdusx and kbdgkl keyboard layouts, covering only the letters and punctuation required by these languages in the intersection of the [IBM923/ISO-8859-15 codepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_9), and the [IBM/DOS 858 codepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP858). Punctuation has been slightly rearranged trying to move nonletters out of the letterspace keyboard, but trying to preserve muscle memory from the Windows keyboard layouts as much as possible. The keyboard layout number is the average between 923 and 858 (890), rounded to a hexadecimal integer.

The keyboard layout `kbdtx42f` supplements `kbdtx37a` with punctuation deemed necessary for these languages taken from [codepage Windows 1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win1252). The number is the average of the previous 890 and 1252 (1071), again rounded to hexadecimal integers.
